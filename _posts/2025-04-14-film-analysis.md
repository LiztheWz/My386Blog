## Recap
Hi, there! Welcome back to Part 2! Sorry to have let you in a cliffhanger... but I'm glad you made it back! So let's do a quick recap from last time. Last post, I explained a little bit about my film curiosities and wanted to determine what features (if any) contribute to a film winning the Academy Award for Best Picture. We talked a little bit about my cleaning struggles (I'm not a data Cinderella after all). Then we found some basic summaries about directors, genres, actors, distributors, etc. 

However, we never dove deep to find out if there truly is a correlation or relationships between a film's features and whether they won or not. So in this post, I'll be rolling out the red carpet to some interesting features.
