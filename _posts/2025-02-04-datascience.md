# Intro to Data Science
## (for us simple minded folks)

I remember when I switched my major to data science and told my Mexican parents, they simply asked, "what is that?" And I had no idea how to respond. "I'm not quite sure, but I'm enjoying it." 

You would think I had enough knowledge to explain my own major but apparently on the spot, I didn't. So what did I do? What any reasonable human being would also do. I googled it. But even google seemed confusing at explaining what data science was. 

So this post is specifically made for those who are found on the same boat as me a few years ago. What in the world is data science??

### What is it? What does it include?
Let's start with the basics. In the most simple form, data science is the study and manipulation of, well, data. I like to think of the data science process like a baking recipe. You have to grab ingredients, mix them up, put it into the oven, then you get a tasty batch of cookies afterwards to take to your friends. 

It's almost as if statistics, math, and computer science had a child and named it Data Science. Data Science then gets some data, does some cool stuff with it that its parents taught it, then presents it. Kind of like all of us when we were kids coming home from school with a cool art project. 

In this post I'll be taking you through the instructions! Here's a quick overview of what to expect of the data science process:
1. Data Collection
2. Data Cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Data Visualization
5. Decision-Making

This isn't really EVERYTHING, but it's the basics of what one should know. So by the end of this post, if someone asks "what is data science?" you should be able to respond with ease! Let's dive in...


### 1. Data Collection 
This is part of the instructions that wants you to gather all your ingredients. Gather all the data you need! And we can do this in several ways:

Direct collection - you go out and gather the data yourself. You can do this through surveys, experiments, observations, interviews, etc. This is anything that requires you to gather data first-hand. Or you could get pre-existing data - someone else already collected the data and has it all organized for you in a big table (dataset). A lot of websites nowadays have datasets ready for the taking. You would just need to webscrape it (take data from websites)!

### 2. Data Cleaning
Just like a manufacturing company has a section that detects weird, abnormal products, we also need to detect any abnormal data in our datasets. The way we do this is by handling missing values, outliers (data very extreme from others), removing duplicate values, and correcting inconsistencies. 

For example, let's say that a dataset has a column named "State." You have some rows that have "NY" and others that have "New York." They're the same thing but they're detected as different so we have to fix inconsistencies like this so they're all the same.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This is the mixing part of the instructions. This is the part where statistics, math, and computer science meet. Here we manipulate data to identify trends, patterns, and make predictions.

In order to do so, we need tools. In data science there are so many programming languages we can use but the most efficient and popular ones are Python (not the snake), R, and SQL (pronounced sequel). Just like in baking we have different measuring cups, in data science we have different programming languages that all have specific strengths.

This is the part of the data science process where we want to get insights. It's the "so what?" part. So yeah, we have all this data and information but it's not that useful until I get some kind of conclusion from it. All data is useless if you can't draw a conclusion. So we have to sort it, analyze it, then present it. During the EDA process it's good to ask yourself, "what do I want to know? What do I have to do to this dataset to find out?" 

### 4. Data Visualization
This is the part where the beautiful cookies finally come out of the oven and we get to decorate them! So after we analyze the data, we have to present it. This is when we can create graphs, charts, and plots to make our data visually appealing for viewers. We could use different platforms to do so, such as: Tableau, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Which type of presentation you want to use will depend on your type of data. We could use line graphs, histograms, box plots, scatter plots, bar charts, etc. Then we present our product!


### 5. Decision-Making
Now that we have a nice graph, chart, or plot, we can tell a story and make predictions. We can use the insights that we've gained during this process to guide our decision-making process. Let's look at an example!

This following link will take you to a page of the United States Census Bureau website. Go ahead and clink on this <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/assets-and-debts.html" target="_blank">link</a>

I'll wait...

This specific page has a line graph over time of net worth, assets, and debt of households from the years 2017-2022. Click on the dark blue tab at the top that says "Net Worth" then click on the dropdown arrow where it says "Select chart." As you can see there's multipe options available, go ahead and click "Education." You should see a nice line graph that looks like this:

<img src="{{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/networth.png" alt="" style="width:300px;"/>


This is a graph that somebody already made. They collected data from the census, cleaned it, analyzed it, then made this nice graph. Now if we were them, we could tell a nice story and make a prediction of whether or not the level of education completed correlates (influences) with the networth of a household. 

If I were the storyteller here, I would say that the higher the level of education completed, the higher the networth of a household. Then I could make a decision of whether or not I wanted to pursue a graduate degree or not. Looking at the graph, I would pursue a graduate degree knowing that my household's networth would also increase.


 ## Wrap-up
 Okay ladies and gents, that was a quick overview of data science! Younger me would be so proud to respond to her Mexican parents what data science is. It's the collection, cleaning, manipulation, and presentation of data. So it kind of is like baking cookies I guess. 

 If you felt comfortable with the explanation in this post, go ahead and check out other advanced websites about data science! Keep learning and expanding. If you know anyone who is also curious to know what data science is, share this post with them! If they refuse becasue they think they'll get confused, let them know it's Data Science for Dummies.
